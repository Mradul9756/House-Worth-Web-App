# House-Worth-Web-App
#### Partnered with: Bhavesh Bhagtani https://github.com/bhagtanib/House-Worth
## Description of the Application
A web-based application to help Whitworth students easily find housing listings near campus. App offers a range of filtering options, such as monthly rent, distance from campus, academic year availability, number of rooms, and number of bathrooms. When a listing is clicked, it takes the user to a separate page with detailed property information, including street views, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom images. This simple and user-friendly platform allows landlords to easily advertise rental properties to student audiences. Additionally, there is an account feature for landlords to manage their listings and stay up to date on potential tenants. Data has been generated from scratch using Python's Faker library with the addition of some manually created fields such as House descriptions.

## Technical Concepts
Followed the rule of 1NF for eliminating repeating groups, 2NF for eliminating redundant data, and 3NF for eliminating transitive dependencies. Ensured that all data types were structured properly, which is important for efficient storage and retrieval. Some other concepts included writing SQL queries to create and manage the database, making functions to perform tasks such as search and CRUD operations, and UML diagrams to visualize how the structure of the database would be organized. In addition, implemented security measures such as authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users have access to the database.
